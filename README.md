It was Five years ago, I was in high school and I accidentally had a chance to be a dancer by doing Breaking, which is a street dance.
 
I deeply remember that it was the second day of my high school and it was so hot outside, which would drives people crazy and make them want to jump into the ice water and take a shower immediately. When I finished my calsses, two girls who just became my friends that day asked, “ if I wondered to learn the Breaking in the school team?” I said yes, because I had wanted to learn to dance for a long time, but in the past few years, I couldn’t squeeze out any time to learn it because of using the limited time in studying.

Later, I followed two girls to the dance studio, and began to learn the Breaking from the captain of the school team whose name is Ken. When we met Ken, he performed his excellent dancing skill. For example, he could handstand in the floor with only one hand acting a posture like the brand symbol of ‘NIKE’. The most wonderful thing was that he would face down, bent his legs and used only one hand to suppoet his body and used his left hand to revolving  his body in high speed. What a brilliant show! 

After the performance, Ken started to teach us how to dance and how to be an outstanding BBOY. He  stood in front of a big mirror, and we imitate him step by step. When I began to dance, it is hard for me to dance smoothly and without mistakes. Surprisingly, after we finished the first day’s training, the captain walked straight to me and said, “ Hi, new guy. I’m Ken. What’s your name?” I said, “ Nice to meet you, captain! My name is Hanris, and today is my first day' training. Thanks for your teaching!” “ Ok, here is the thing, I noticed you today.  Your motion and feeling to the bits, which impresses me a lot and I have never seen it happened in a new guy before. And I think you have talent for the Breaking, and I want you to keep training in here! Hoping you will be in my position someday!” said by Ken.

Since then I would go to the studio every afternoon after I finished my class at 5 pm. I also had a night class at 7 pm every day. So, I used most of these two hours to dance. At the period, I would get sweat all the time, and my clothes did not get dry for only one second. when I was training, I learned how to handstand  andFootWalks, which a type of motion that use your body and hands to perform some combo on the floor. Each time, when I was  training, I felt the sore and ache go through all over and my fingers and could not stretch without huge a sense of pain! This feeling was bad。 After finished my studio’s hard time, I left only 20 minutes until my class in school. In order to saving time, I only took a bath as quick as I could, and di not use towel to dry my whole body, and dressed my school uniform when my body still wet. Hard life didn’t over yet, because I needed to dash to my classroom, which liked the athletes want to win a gold medal in a running competition. Most embarrassing  thing is  half hour later, my stomach kept making noises and complained “ I need to eat. I want to eat now!” but I could not eat until 9 pm that I had a break. After night class and back to my dorm, I  couldn’t sleep, because I need to stick medical plasters in my back and applied some medicinal liquid in my hands, ankles, elbows and my leg to ease my pain!

At this moment, there were two voices beside my ears, one of them was “ Hanris, you should quit the Breaking, because you don’t have to torture yourself in this way and you can lease a happy life without this training. Am I right?” the other was “ Hey, budy, you are meant to be a captain in future and I believe you can get through these difficulties! You just need to hand on!” and I reminded that Ken’s voice kept knocking my head over and over again “You are talent at the Breaking! You will be a captain someday!”  I chose to follow my destiny, which is what Ken told me What I meant to be. I  made the Breaking be a part of my life, and stated to enjoy the pain, because I believe practise makes perfect.

Finally, because of my hard working, I got a chance to have a show with my captain to dance in front of students and teachers at school yearly festival. At my second year at high school,  I took over my captain’s position and complete my dream finally. All of those wonderful achievements were all owed to the faith in my heart at the most beginning!
